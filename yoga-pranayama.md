Yoga breath exercises

[Pranayama for Beginners: Learn About the Practice + How to Start](https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/beginners/how-to/pranayama/)

## Notes from class
* start with a technique: longer inhale or longer exhale
  * 6 count inhale, 4 count exhale (or flipped)
  * box breathing: 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold
* then meditate on a place: third eye, heart, belly
* exercise tonight: start from belly, breathing fully up, breathing out focusing on third eye
* longer inhales bring in energy, so focus should be on higher parts of body.
