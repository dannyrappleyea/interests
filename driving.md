Notes about driving, habits, and laws.

## Slower traffic keep right
* All 50 (US) states have a law around slower traffic keeping right. Most have a law that slower traffic must be in the right lane (regardless of speed limit). Some have more restrictive laws around using the left lane only for passing.
* People generally suck at following these.
