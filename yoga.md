# My own crazy practices
Yoga is body mastery. Exploring the body. Muscle and bone, gravity and time. And the mind.

## Movements
I've been focusing on my own variations of yoga poses. Some are more of a dynamic yin, held for a long time but with small circles inside of a certain pose. Others are larger movement poses, repeated an refined.

### Yin Mountain
Stand in mountain for at least five minutes.

Mountain is about the root chakra. Not in the sense of imagining some mystical color, but the lowest point of balance for your spine. It's the bands of muscles focused just above your hip bones. Use only those muscles to keep your balance. Let all the other be as relaxed as possible, especially the shoulders. Now breathe.

Your pelvis should move forwards and back, perfectly in time with your breath. It should exude a tilting motion, rocking on the top of the leg bones. Play with exagerated movements, so the pelvis rolls in figure 8s, twisting the torso to each side. Let it fade to almost stillness, with long breaths lasting many seconds.

### Two Blocks
Take two sturdy yoga blocks, cork works well. Place them wider than shoulder width on a carpet. Stand on them. The carpet should let them move a little, up and down. Press evenly straight down from each foot.
* Squat. Come back up.
* On each breath, sweep fingertips up to the sky.
* Shift from tree on block, to tree on the other block.

### Hands and Knees Spinal Wheel
Hand and knees, spine straight. Focus on the tailbone. Let the spine sink, letting it drape from pelvis to shoulder like a suspension bridge. Let your attention fall with them, into the valley, then rolling uphill to the shoulders. Then shoulders roll up as the spine lifts, attention following an arc into the air peaking mid spine. Then it curves and races down to the tailbone again.

It's like a giant ball bearing is using your spine to draw a circle. Tailbone, spine low, shoulders, spine high. Turning round and round.

### Squat
Squat as low to the ground as you can get. Move feet out as wide as you need, maybe turning them each out 45 degrees. Hands in prayer with elbows pressing into each knee. Back as straight as possible. Deep belly breathing, so that hands move away on the in breath, towards you on the out breath.

## Breathing
Ways of breathing
* Always breathe up. All upwards movements of the body on the in breath, downward movements on the out breath.

# Yin Yoga
Yin yoga is more focused on the connective tissue within the body, rather than the muscles, most especially the fascia around all the muscles. Poses are held longer, for at least 3-5 minutes, because fascia needs at least 2 minutes to start stretching. That also gives muscles time to relax and stretch.

Slower breaths both deepen the stretch, and makes the practice more meditative. Props are heavily used to support the body in the poses to make it easier to relax.

## Try?
* Jade Harmony (4.7mm) - open cell rubber - ‚Äústays sticky when wet, but still doesn‚Äôt offer the traction of the Gaiam Sol‚Äù. Very textured, grippy, but not like the lululemon
* Jade Fusion Yoga Mat (68x24x8mm) - open cell rubber (maybe too thick)
* PrAna Revolution Mat - open cell rubber
* Hugger Mugger Para Yoga Mat  (70x24x?) - open cell rubber - ‚ÄúThe mat felt secure and sticky, even when spritzed with water. ‚Äú
* Manduka eKO - ‚Äúfairly good grip, wet or dry‚Äù

## Don‚Äôt consider
* Manduka Pro Yoga Mat
* Manduka Prolite Yoga Mat
* Hugger Mugger Tapas Ultra Mat - ‚ÄúSimilar to the Manduka Pro Lite, this mat just didn‚Äôt hold up well when spritzed with water. ‚Äú
* Tomuno Yoga Mat - closed cell rubber
* Aurorae Synergy Hot Yoga Mat - mat with bonded towel
* Aurorae Classic Thick Yoga Mat - ‚Äúslips when wet‚Äù
* YETI BOWIE YOGA MAT - ‚Äúslips when wet‚Äù
* Lululemon Namastay-Mat-Marbled - lots of comments about slipping

## Notes
Standard mat size is 68x24‚Äù
Options: PVC yoga mats have the highest sticky factor.
