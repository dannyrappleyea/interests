# Brewing coffee
## Pour Over Coffee
* Total brew time should be 3-4 minutes
* Water temp 195-205 deg F
* Coffee/water ratio of 1:17

Notes
10 oz water = 295g + extra, so about 360g
1:17 ratio is 21g coffee

1. Rinse paper filter and prewarm brewer and cup
2. Bloom for 30 seconds
3. Pour water, aiming to finish pouring at 3:00
4. Drip should stop at 4:00

## Aeropress
1. Put plunger in chamber and turn upside down
2. 17g coffee
3. 250-290g water (260g using #61 from Art of Aeropress link)
4. Pour 260 grams of water slowly over coffee in a circular motion, taking approximately 46 seconds
5. Stir once 
6. Place plunger onto Aeropress and let brew for another 47 seconds 
7. Plunge slowly for 48 seconds serve
8. (Avg seems to be ~2min total time)


Interesting notes from Internet
* Reduced steep time if a coffee has more sweetness accessible like a fruit forward natural process. A longer steep time is used to develop balance/sweeter notes in a heavier washed coffee
* Smaller grind will bring acidity forward. For coffees heavy on earthy tones or chocolate, I like a more coarse grind
* Yadi: 17g coffee, 235g water @81degC, 2:25 brew time

# Coffee Tasting around the world - Carrboro coffee roasters
Instructor: Ryan 4 Year’s at ccr, 9 yrs coffee
Pour over, bloom, all at once, stirring. 
Ethiopian, high altitude, fruity, flowery, sometimes sweet
Ethiopian yurd? Barely roasted. Dates. Washed
Ethiopian ardi ? Blueberry. Because of processing (natural?)
Ethiopians show sour, acidity

Sumatra: one of the richest. Good example of dark without bitter. Cedar, molasses, 
Brazil. Smoky chocolate 
Central America’s. More chocolate, nuts
Honduras. More melon sweetness 
Peru. Natural process. Blueberry. Pepper. Butter?  Grapefruit
—
At most 18 lbs at a time, becomes 15 lbs roasted coffee. Roast, then cool as quick as possible. 

Lower temps water, more sweetness

## Processing
* Natural: dried with the fruit on. Picks up fruit flavors. Dry countries
	* Ethiopia, Yemen, Uganda, Myanmar
* Wet/washed: de-skinned, washed to remove fruit, dried
	* Kenya: longer wash/ferment that adds to acidity
* Honey (pulped natural): de-skinned, then dried. Halfway between natural/washed. Low acidity
	* Brazil
* Wet hulling: like honey, except a short drying period, fruit removed and dried again. Picks up qualities of earth or asphalt where dried
	* Sumatra: method unique to this country?

[Coffee Processing Basics | Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/coffee-processing-basics)

## Caffeine
* 40g coffee beans ~ 336mg caffeine (so 200mg = 24g beans)
* 8oz cup brewed coffee ~100mg
* Darker roasts have 10-15% less caffeine
* Robusta has roughly twice the caffeine as Arabica beans

## Roast - Antron scale
Light: >70
* Light brown to cinnamon color
* Lightish body, sometimes muted aroma, tea-like flavor
* No oil on surface of bean

Medium – Light: 61 – 70
* Moderately light brown color
* Bright, sweet acidity, green coffee distinctions clear
* Surface of bean remains dry

Medium: 51 – 60
* Medium brown color
* Balanced acidity, fuller body, green coffee distinctions still apparent
* Generally dry bean surface

Medium – Dark: 41 – 50
* Rich brown color
* Droplets of oil appear on bean surface
* Fruit turns chocolaty, hints of roasty bittersweetness emerge
* Muted acidity, sometimes heavier body

Dark: 35 – 40
* Deep brownish/black color
* Spots of oil to shiny surface
* Bittersweet, scorched-wood roast notes are prominent
* Acidity muted

Very Dark: 25 – 34
* Black surface covered brightly with oil
* Bitter/bittersweet tones dominate
* Body thins, green coffee distinctions are fully muted

Extreme – Dark: < 25
Black, shiny surface
Burned bitter tones dominate

## Decaffeination process
Indirect solvent: 
* water extracts caffeine, methylene chloride or ethyl acetate takes caffeine from water, water put back in beans
* popular in Europe

Direct solvent:
* steam beans, soak in methylene chloride or ethyl acetate to remove caffeine, steam beans again to remove chemicals

Swiss water process
* water dissolves caffeine, goes through charcoal filter to remove caffeine, that water used to process next batch (preserving its flavor, but removing caffeine

CO2 process
* high-pressure CO2 dissolves caffeine without taking flavor
