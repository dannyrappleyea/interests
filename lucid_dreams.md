# Lucid Dream
Knowing you're dreaming enough to affect the dream.

## Would like to do in dreams
* Look in a mirror
* Try to jump up and down

## Done in dreams

Surreal
* die, several times and ways

Fly
* fly up to treetop level
* go into space
* drive down the road in a car, still going that speed after the car disappears
* hover above a floor
* like a ninja across a room in slow motion, pushing off each surface using only my big toe
* jump down entire flights of stairs

Listen
* to a symphony

See
* several bookshelves, recognizing tech books from 20 years ago

Powers
* pushed a building wall in, so it deformed into a sideways dome
* walk through a wall
* pull my head through a wall
* skipped through to the end of time, then reset it

# Wierd dream effects
Gravity, when noticed, rarely pulls more a quarter of earth normal.

Books and screens
* words are ever the same way twice
* using maps on my phone makes no sense

Light switches don’t work right. You can see, regardless of whether they're on or off.


## Almost impossible to do in dreams
* Read. Anything to do with written words. They don’t stay the same twice
* Anything involving computers. Words and images never stay the same.
